# data-sci-MLP-NN-Iris

Hello, 

The purpose of this repository is to display the previous work i have completed within the domain of Data Science. These two files work on the Iris Dataset in categorizing which each flower is based on various features using a MultiLayerPerceptron Neural Network. There is no external data file on this one as the iris dataset is available through python's open source library.

Best, Eugenia.
